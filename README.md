# Predictive Modeling Of Electric Vehicles Adoption Rates Using Bass Diffusion Model

The fact that the adoption of electric vehicles (EV) is increasing at a rather fast pace brings the problem of predicting the further behavior of the market, especially regarding the absence of charging systems and market instability as well as the high cost of entry. The high cost of entry in the electric vehicle (EV) market refers to the significant financial barriers that prevent consumers from purchasing EVs, even with the long-term savings they offer. This is primarily due to the high upfront price of the vehicle, which is largely driven by the cost of the battery. This high initial cost, combined with the instability of charging systems and perceived market instability, acts as a major deterrent to mass adoption. To be efficient in resources allocation and infrastructure planning, policymakers and manufacturers need to have effective predictive models. Conventional statistical models also tend to be inadequate in accounting the dynamic patterns in the behaviour of EV adoption. Although the variables like government policy, infrastructure, or consumer behaviour are no part of the Bass Diffusion Model, during the interpretation of regional adoption trends and model performance these were considered. The research has focused on examining the adoption of EVs in the United States based on the Bass Diffusion Model in predicting adoption rates in various states. The model was calibrated and validated through the information on past sales and charge infrastructure statistics. The process of the research implied data preprocessing, estimation of the parameters, and evaluation of performance based on the error measures, including Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The evidence demonstrates that the policy, infrastructure, and socioeconomic context is an important factor in adoption. The model was found very accurate with a MAPE of only 7.03% in a high-adoption state such as California. States with poorer infrastructure appeared by contrast less accurate, with MAPE above 23.00%. Such findings indicate that the model is most effective with clearly defined and favourable policy environment. The research can be used to give policymakers and other stakeholders responsible in this industry practical findings that can be used to roll- out a predictive framework that will help in formulating such strategies as EV infrastructure and market expansion to facilitate a more sustainable transport future.
